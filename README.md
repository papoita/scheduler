# Interview Scheduler
* Interview Scheduler is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to book technical interviews between students and mentors.
 * Each appointment has one student and one interviewer. When creating a new appointment, the user can enter any student name while the interviewer is chosen from a predefined list.
  * The user can save the appointment and view the entire schedule of appointments on any day of the week. Appointments can also be edited or deleted. 
  
  ** The front end of this project is built with React and makes requests to an API to fetch and store appointment data from a database.
